## Getting Started

Hokusai aims to provide a smooth CI workflow on a per-project basis.  As such, it is designed to be configured and run from a shell within a project's git repo.

We will assume you have already installed Hokusai and run `hokusai configure`, as detailed in [Setup](../README.md#Setup).

1) Setup Hokusai for a Rails project

```bash
cd ./path/to/my/rails/project/git/repo
hokusai setup --project-type ruby-rails
```

`hokusai setup` will create:
- A `Dockerfile` in your project root
- A configuration folder `./hokusai`.  This folder contains:
  * `config.yml` - Hokusai project configuration
  * `common.yml` - a Docker Compose YAML file imported by `development.yml` and `test.yml`
  * `development.yml`- a Docker Compose YAML file for the development environment
  * `test.yml` - a Docker Compose YAML file for the test environment
  * `staging.yml` - a Kubernetes YAML file for the staging environment
  * `production.yml` - a Kubernetes YAML file for the production environment
- An ECR repository for your project

The files in `./hokusai` as well as the `Dockerfile` are meant to be a starting point for development of your specific application's dependencies, and can / should be freely modified, as you customize your Docker build, add service dependencies to your environments, introduce environment variables, or change the container runtime commands.  See [Configuration Options](./Configuration_Options.md) if you want to modify your project's configuration.

2) Check that Hokusai is correctly configured for your project

`hokusai check` will run a series of tests and warn you if it finds anything improperly configured.

3) Run the development environment

`hokusai dev start` will build a Docker image, then start a Docker Compose environment defined by `./hokusai/development.yml`

If this command throws no errors, try interacting with the running environment with:

```bash
hokusai dev status
hokusai dev logs
hokusai dev run bash
```

To shut down the environment's running containers, run `hokusai dev stop`

Container filesystems will be preserved between environment starts and stops, unless you run `hokusai dev clean`, in which case the container filesystems will be deleted.

See [Configuration Options](./Configuration_Options.md) if you want to modify your development environment's configuration.


4) Run the test suite in the test environment

`hokusai test` will build a Docker image, start a Docker Compose environment defined by `./hokusai/test.yml`, run the defined test command in the main (project-name) container to completion, and return its exit code.

See [Configuration Options](./Configuration_Options.md) if you want to modify your test environment's configuration.

5) Build and push an image to ECR

`hokusai registry push` will build and push an image to ECR.  By default, it tags the image as the SHA1 of the HEAD of your current git branch (by calling `git rev-parse HEAD`).  You can override this behavior with the `--tag` option, although this is not recommended as creating builds matched to the SHA1 of Git tags gives you a clean view of your ECR project repository and deployment history.

The command will also tag the image as `latest`.  This image tag should not be referenced in any Kubernetes YAML configuration, but serves only as a pointer, which is referenced when creating a Kubernetes environment.

The command aborts if any of the following conditions is met:
- The working directory is not clean (you have uncommitted changes)
- The working directory contains any files specified in your `.gitignore` file
- The project registry already contains the specified tag

The reason for these conditional checks is that when building, Docker will copy your _entire_ working directory into the container image, which can produce unexpected results when building images 
ly, destined for production environments!  Hokusai aborts if it detects the working directory is unclean, or any ignored files or directories are present, as it attempts to prevent any local configuration leaking into container images.

Once an image is pushed, you can list the images and tags in the project registry with: `hokusai registry images`.

6) Create the Kubernetes staging environment and environment configuration

```bash
hokusai staging env create
hokusai staging env set FOO=bar
```

See [Configuration Options](./Configuration_Options.md) if you want to modify your staging environment's configuration.


7) Create the Kubernetes staging environment with `hokusai staging create`

`hokusai staging status` should eventually (once Kubernetes creates a load balancer for your project), output the ELB's DNS record.

Get logs by running `hokusai staging logs` and see deployment history with `hokusai staging history`

8) Create the Kubernetes production environment and environment configuration

```bash
hokusai production env create
hokusai production env set FOO=baz
```

See [Configuration Options](./Configuration_Options.md) if you want to modify your production environment's configuration.

9) Create the Kubernetes production environment

```bash
hokusai production create
hokusai production status
hokusai production logs
hokusai production history
```

10) Deploy changes to the Kubernetes staging environment

Create a new commit and push it to the registry with `hokusai registry push` as before.

Deploy the new commit to staging with `hokusai production deploy {TAG}` where TAG is the tag of the commit you just made.

11) Promote the tag deployed on staging to production

```bash
hokusai pipeline promote
```
